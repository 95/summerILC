# 2023 Summer ILC: LUA Game Development (6CR)

The primary project of this quarter has been the two player obstacle game, which requires players to work together by
standing on different color buttons to reveal paths, move elevators, and use portals in order to get to the end. 

The repository does not include the assets for the ROBLOX game itself, such as interfaces, parts, etc. They cannot be easily exported and viewed independently from the ROBLOX studio platform. It also doesn't include any test scripts that I wrote in order to solidify my understanding of the various topics I covered this quarter. 

The OOP test code is for when I wanted to learn Object Oriented Programming in LUA.
I made a round-based match system, complete with a match-begin interface.

This has been a fulfilling quarter for me as a programmer. Game development allowed me to think about
organizing my code in an entirely different way, and helped me develop skills such as modular thinking and 
improved my object-oriented-programming skills. I spent a lot of time throughout this quarter working on these games, and I will continue to do so in the future. I enjoyed my time a lot, and I hope that this can be reflected in the finished product. The game is not published to the website yet, as I have a few more things I'd like to add, but all in all, it is a completely functional game with more than 18 unique stages with different functionality.

I also learned a bit about level design within the realm of ROBLOX, and had to get comfortable with the ROBLOX studio interface. This was time consuming, but not exceedingly difficult.

My primary sources of information have been:
https://devforum.roblox.com/ (an incredibly kind and helpful forum for anyone who wants to pursue LUA game development)
https://create.roblox.com/docs (sometimes confusing, but generally helpful for more broader libraries)
https://www.youtube.com/@GnomeCode (wonderful for datastores, pathfinding, and raycasting information)

Thank you for allowing me to do this. It was wonderful and I learned a lot. More than I can write down here.

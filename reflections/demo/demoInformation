Each demo video includes a video of me testing an individual function that I'd like to showcase.
The first is the elevator, which uses the ROBLOX tweening service to broadcast part movement across the entire server.
The second is the portals demo, where I used a trick with attribute manipulation to add a "debounce" and cooldown so people wouldn't teleport back and forth.
The third is of the timer and spinner, in which the "spinner" is locally moving to reduce lag, and the timer works as intended with a GUI part representing how much time is left.
